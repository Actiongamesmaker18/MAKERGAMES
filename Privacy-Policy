This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of GoodActionGames (“GoodActionGames,” “we,” “us” or “our”) for the mobile games, apps, services, features, content, or any portion thereof, owned, controlled, or made available by GoodActionGames (collectively, with the Site, the “Services”). This Privacy Policy governs our collection of information from you (“you,” “your” or a “user”) through your use of the Services. It does not apply to any information you may provide to us through other means; for example, via mail or via telephone. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand our online privacy practices. By visiting or using the Services, you agree that your visit or use, and any dispute over our online privacy practices, is governed by this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service. Questions regarding privacy issues should be directed to us at ActionGamesMaker@outlook.fr.
1.    TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT.
The information we gather falls into two categories: (a) information voluntarily supplied by users to the Services; and (b) tracking information gathered as users use or navigate through the Services.
1.1            Information You Provide to Us.
We may collect and store information, personal or otherwise, that you voluntarily supply while using the Services. Some examples of this type of information include demographic information and personal information (such as your name, address, or email address) that you electronically submit when you contact us from the Services. If you want to keep the information in your message private or proprietary, please do not send such information to us. The information you provide to us may include, without limitation:
1.    Information that you provide to us when you register for an account, such as your name, address, phone number, usernames or IDs,  birthdate, and email address;
2.    Information that you provide to us and/or our third party service providers when you purchase a mobile, app, game, in-app or in-game purchases, products or services, such as payment card, billing and delivery information;
3.    Information that you provide to us and/or our third party service providers if you participate in a sweepstakes, contest, rewards program, or other promotion;
4.    Information that you provide if you use the Services to upload, share, or communicate any content or information, including photos, images, videos, text, social network accounts, or other personal information that you may include about yourself or others;
5.    Information that you publicly post via social media networks, forums, blogs, message boards, chat rooms or similar functionality is public information that we, or others, may share or use in accordance with the law;
6.    Information that you provide when you submit and/or sell assets or content via the Services;
7.    Information that you provide if you email, phone, contact or communicate with us or our third party service providers, such as your email address or phone number.
1.2            Tracking Information.
We also may collect and store information that is generated automatically as you navigate through the Services. For example, to help make the Services more responsive to the needs of users, we employ a standard feature of browser software, called a “cookie,” to assign each user a unique, random number that resides on a user’s computer. The cookie does not personally identify the user; it merely identifies the computer with which the user accesses the Services. However, if a user voluntarily identifies himself or herself (through registration, for example), the Services may be able to ascertain the identity of the user through a cookie assigned to an identified user’s computer. The only personal information a cookie can refer to is information supplied by a user. By showing how and when visitors use the Services, cookies help us track user trends and patterns. We also may use web beacons and other methods to access cookies and to count users who visit the Services or open our HTML-formatted email messages. The Services’ servers automatically collect limited information about your computer’s connection to the Internet, including your IP address. The IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send data - such as the web pages users view. An IP address does not personally identify a user. We use this information to deliver the Services’ content to you upon request and to measure traffic within the Services.
We may use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to collect non-personally identifiable information about users of the Services and about activity that occurs within the Services, and we may use this information to, among other things, serve targeted offers on the Services. The information collected allows us to analyze how users use the Services and to track user interests, trends and patterns.
1.3            Third Party Tracking.
In addition to first party cookies and/or other first party identifiers described herein, we also may use third party tracking and analytics services and the companies providing such services may use their own cookies, web beacons and similar technologies. The collection and use of information by these companies is governed by the relevant third party’s privacy policy and is not covered by this Privacy Policy. We do not have access to cookies that may be placed on your computer by third party technology, servers or networks.
1.4            iOS and Android Platforms
When you use any of our games or applications on a mobile platform, we may collect and record certain information such as your unique device ID (persistent / non-persistent), hardware type, media access control (“MAC”) address, international mobile equipment identity (“IMEI”), the version of your operating system (“OS”), your device name, your email address (if you have logged in using your email address), and your location (based on your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address).  This information is useful to us for troubleshooting and helps us understand usage trends.
1.5            Game Data.
Whenever you use one of GoodActionGames’s games or applications on a mobile platform, we collect data about your interactions with the game or application and with the other users via server, mobile app, or game log files.  In addition, we create a unique user ID to track your use of our Services. This unique user ID is stored in connection with your profile information to track the games, applications or Services you are using. This information may be associated with your player ID, IP address or device ID for the purpose of providing you our Services and improving them.
1.6            Diagnostic Data.
We, or our third party service providers, may collect, analyze, and store information about crashes and errors in the Services (“Error Data”). This contains information about how and why the Services crashed on your device or system. Error Data may include diagnostic information to help us reproduce and resolve errors in the Services (“Diagnostic Data”). Diagnostic Data may contain information about users of the Services.
1.7             Location Information.
When you access or use the Services, or any portion thereof, we may collect physical location information that is sufficiently precise to allow us to locate a specific person or device (“Location Information”). We only collect Location Information with your permission (e.g., such as when you agree to provide it to us after you initially access or use the Services). We may use Location Information and provide it to third parties to provide you with content and services that are relevant to a particular location, such as advertising, search results, dealers in the area, and directions. We may collect your Location Information for the purpose of providing you with the correct version of the application. If you no longer wish to allow us to track or use this information, you may turn it off at the device level.
1.8            Do Not Track Disclosures.
We may also use tracking technologies to collect information about your visits over time and across third party websites or other online services. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies and to opt-out of most third party tracking, you may go to:

By default most browsers are setup to accept cookies. You may set your web browser to disable cookies; however, doing so may render you unable to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other users of the Services. Some browsers include a feature, sometimes termed “Private Browsing” or “Incognito,” requesting that a website visited by that browser not set and store permanent cookies (collectively, “Do Not Track” features). Certain functionality of the Services may be limited by use of Do Not Track features. By continuing to use the features of the Services and accepting cookies you recognize that you have a choice to disable cookies and you consent to their use as described in this Privacy Policy.
2.    USE, DISCLOSURE AND RETENTION OF INFORMATION.
We use the information we collect in a variety of ways, including using the information to customize features and content that appear on the Services. You agree that we may use your information to contact you for customer service purposes, to inform you of important changes or additions to the Services or the services offered over the Services, and to send you administrative notices, offers and any other communications that we believe may be of interest to you.
We may share non-financial information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Please be aware that we may occasionally release information about users when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our Terms of Service or to protect the rights, property or safety of other users of the Services, the public or us.
Please also note that, in the unlikely event that GoodActionGames, or some or all of our assets, or the Services are acquired by another company, information about our users may be among the transferred assets.
We will retain your information for as long as your GoodActionGames account is active or as needed to provide you the Services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you the Services, contact us at ActionGamesMaker@outlook.fr. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
3.            THIRD PARTIES AND OTHER SHARING OF INFORMATION.
3.1            Third Party Links.

Once you leave the Services, any information you provide at another site will be governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting. The privacy policies of third party websites may differ from ours.
3.2            Social Networks.
The Services may include features that connect with social networks. These social networks may collect information, such as your IP address, or which page you are visiting on the Services, and may set a cookie to enable the features to function properly. The social network providing the features on the Services may be able to collect information about you, even if you don’t use those features. To control this sharing of information, please review the privacy policy of the relevant social network.
Please also keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your personal information available for viewing by third parties online - for example through email or by you choosing to share your information with users of social networks (e.g., VK, Facebook, Twitter or Pinterest) - that information can be seen, collected and used by others besides GoodActionGames. We cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third party use of such information.
3.3            Promotions and Sweepstakes.
Promotions or sweepstakes offered on the Services may be sponsored by unaffiliated third parties. Information that you provide as part of an entry into a promotion or sweepstakes sponsored by an unaffiliated third party will be shared with the sponsor. You should carefully review the official rules of each promotion or sweepstakes that you enter as they may contain additional important information about the use of your personal information.
3.4            Service Providers.
We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us or on our behalf. We may share your private personal information with such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.
3.5            Payment Information.
If you provide payment information for any services on the Services, we will share your payment information with payment services providers to process payments; prevent, detect and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities; facilitate dispute resolution such as chargebacks or refunds; and for other purposes associated with the acceptance of credit or debit cards.
3.6            Invite a Friend.
We may offer you the opportunity to invite your contacts (such as your Facebook friends) so that those contacts can be located in the Services and/or so that you can invite them to join you in using the Services. Such contact information will be used only for the purpose of sending communications to the addressee.  You or your friends may contact us at ActionGamesMaker@outlook.fr to request the removal of this information from our database to the extent we store any of this information.
3.7            Push Notifications.
We may occasionally send you push notifications through the Services to send you updates, high scores and other service related notifications that may be of importance to you.  You may at any time opt-out from receiving these types of communications by turning them off at the device level through your settings.
3.8 Google Analytics.
We use Google Analytics (“Google Analytics”), a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”), including Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting features. Google Analytics uses “cookies.” The information generated by the cookies about your use of the Site (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Site, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Site. By using the Site, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.

4.    TRANSFER AND STORAGE OF INFORMATION.
We use reasonable physical, technical, and administrative measures to safeguard your information against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification. We also take steps to ensure that only those employees, agents, and contractors who have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your information are granted access. However, as effective as the reasonable security measures we implement may be, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our systems, nor can we guarantee that information supplied will not be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet.
5.    CORRECTING OR REMOVING INFORMATION.
You can send an email to ActionGamesMaker@outlook.fr to correct or remove your personal information from our database for marketing purposes, if we are not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes. We may retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some period of time to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies.
6.    CHANGES TO THIS POLICY.
The Internet and relevant state and federal law is always evolving. If we need to change this Privacy Policy at some point in the future, we will post the modified Privacy Policy on the Services and update the Effective Date of the policy to reflect the date of the changes. By continuing to use the Services after the Effective Date of any such changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as modified.
7.    CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE.
The Services are not directed to children. You must be 13 years and older to register to use the Services. As a result, we do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that information has been collected from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. We recommend that minors between the ages of 13 and 18 ask and receive their parents’ permission before using the Services or sending information about themselves or anyone else over the Internet.
